## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

I've made this Quiz App to refresh my memory of vanilla JS HTML and CSS without frameworks or libraries being used. It's a Quiz that anyone can use to revise random questions that have been added through a free-access Trivia API.

It includes the Home page the Game page and the Highscore page and has a simple user friendy UI.

This project was a build up of a course I took that helped me remmember the things i might've forgotten or have missed in the past projects.
